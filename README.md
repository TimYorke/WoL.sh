# WoL.sh
WoL.sh is a simple shell Wake-on-LAN script.

## Compatibility
WoL.sh should (but is not guaranteed to) work on Mac or Linux systems.  The author used this utility from a macOS 10.15.3 system to wake up a Windows 10 PC.

## Why WoL.sh
<b>WoL.sh does not require installation.</b>  Most authors recommend the use of dedicated programs to perform Wake-on-LAN.  A common one for Macs is "wakeonlan".  These programs are well-tested and probably have more features than WoL.sh.  But there are scenarios where installing a program is not allowed (e.g. on a company machine) or there may be legitimate concerns with installing unknown software.

## What is Wake-on-LAN or Wake-on-WLAN?
A computer can be configured to wake from sleep when it receieves a special network message known as a "Magic Packet".  This technique is known as "Wake-on-LAN" (for a computer using a wired connection) or "Wake-on-WLAN" (for a computer using a wireless connection).
